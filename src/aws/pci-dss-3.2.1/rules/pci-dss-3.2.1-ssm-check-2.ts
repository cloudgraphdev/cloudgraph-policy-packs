    'SSM Check 2: Instances managed by Systems Manager should have an association compliance status of COMPLIANT',
  description: `This control checks whether the status of the AWS Systems Manager association compliance is COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT after the association is run on an instance. The control passes if the association compliance status is COMPLIANT.

  A State Manager association is a configuration that is assigned to your managed instances. The configuration defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed.
  
  After you create one or more State Manager associations, compliance status information is immediately available to you in the console or in response to AWS CLI commands or corresponding Systems Manager API operations. For associations, **Configuration Compliance** shows statuses of **Compliant** or **Non-compliant** and the severity level assigned to the association, such as **Critical** or **Medium**. To learn more about State Manager association compliance, see [About State Manager association compliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-compliance-about.html#sysman-compliance-about-association) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
  
  You must configure your in-scope EC2 instances for Systems Manager association. You must also configure the patch baseline for the security rating of the vendor of patches, and set the autoapproval date to meet PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirement 6.2. For additional guidance on how to create an association, see [Create an association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-assoc.html) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. For additional information on working with patching in Systems Manager, see [AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
  
  **Note**
  This control is not supported in the following Regions.

  * Africa (Cape Town)

  * Asia Pacific (Osaka)

  * Europe (Milan)`,
  rationale: `**PCI DSS 2.4 Maintain an inventory of system components that are in scope for PCI DSS.**
  
  If you use EC2 instances managed by Systems Manager to collect inventory for your cardholder data environment (CDE), make sure that the instances are successfully associated. To do this, check whether the compliance status of the Systems Manager association compliance is COMPLIANT. Using Systems Manager can help to maintain an inventory of system components that are in scope for PCI DSS. For additional guidance on how to organize inventory, see [Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.`,
  remediation: `A failed association can be related to different things, including targets and SSM document names. To remediate this issue, you must first identify and investigate the association. You can then update the association to correct the specific issue.

  You can edit an association to specify a new name, schedule, severity level, or targets. After you edit an association, Systems Manager creates a new version.

  **To investigate and update a failed association**

  This rule checks whether the compliance status of the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager patch compliance is COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT. To find out more about patch compliance states, see the [AWS Systems Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/about-patch-compliance-states.html).
  
  1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.
  
  2. In the navigation pane, under **Node Management**, choose **Fleet Manager**.
  
  3. Choose the instance ID that has an **Association status** of **Failed**.
  
  4. Choose **View details**.
  
  5. Choose **Associations**.
  
  6. Note the name of the association that has an **Association status** of **Failed**. This is the association that you need to investigate. You need to use the association name in the next step.
  
  7. In the navigation pane, under **Node Management**, choose **State Manager**. Search for the association name, then select the association. After you determine the issue, edit the failed association to correct the problem. For information on how to edit an association, see [Edit an association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-assoc-edit.html).
