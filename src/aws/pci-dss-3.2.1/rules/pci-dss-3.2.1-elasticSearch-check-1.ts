  title: 'ElasticSearch Check 1: ElasticSearch domains should be in a VPC',
  description: `This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains are in a VPC.

  It does not evaluate the VPC subnet routing configuration to determine public reachability.
  
  This AWS control also does not check whether the OpenSearch Service resource-based policy permits public access by other accounts or external entities. You should ensure that Elasticsearch domains are not attached to public subnets. See [Resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ac.html#ac-types-resource) in the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.
  
  You should also ensure that your VPC is configured according to the recommended best practices. See [Security best practices for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.html) in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
  
  This control is not supported in Asia Pacific (Osaka).`,
  rationale: `**PCI DSS 1.2.1: Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.**

  If your OpenSearch Service clusters contain cardholder data, the OpenSearch Service domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between OpenSearch Service and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.

  This method is used to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.

  **PCI DSS 1.3.1: Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.**

  If your OpenSearch Service clusters contain cardholder data, the OpenSearch Service domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between OpenSearch Service and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.

This method is used to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.

  **PCI DSS 1.3.2: Limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.**

  If your OpenSearch Service clusters contain cardholder data, the OpenSearch Service domains should be placed in a VPC, which enables secure communication between OpenSearch Service and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.

This method is used to limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.

You can also use a resource-based policy and specify an IP condition for restricting access based on source IP addresses. See the blog post [How to control access to your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-control-access-to-your-amazon-elasticsearch-service-domain/).

  **PCI DSS 1.3.4: Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.**

  If your OpenSearch Service clusters contain cardholder data, the OpenSearch Service domains should be placed in a VPC, which enables secure communication between OpenSearch Service and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.

This method is used to block unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.

  **PCI DSS 1.3.6: Place system components that store cardholder data (such as a database) in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks.**
  
  If your OpenSearch Service clusters contain cardholder data, the OpenSearch Service domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between OpenSearch Service and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.

  remediation: `If you create a domain with a public endpoint, you cannot later place it within a VPC. Instead, you must create a new domain and migrate your data.

  The reverse is also true. If you create a domain within a VPC, it cannot have a public endpoint. Instead, you must either [create another domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html) or disable this control.`,
