  description:
    'This control checks whether user access keys exist for the root user.',
  rationale: `**PCI DSS 2.1: Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.**
  The AWS account root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.

  No access keys should be created for the root user, as this may violate the requirement to remove or disable unnecessary default accounts.

  **PCI DSS 2.2: Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards.**
  The root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.

  No access keys should be created for the root user, as this may violate the requirement to implement system hardening configurations.

  **PCI DSS 7.2.1: Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user’s need to know, and is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed. This access control system(s) must include the following: Coverage of all system components.**
  The root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.

  No access keys should be created for the root user. Doing so might violate the requirement to ensure access to systems components is restricted to least privilege necessary, or a user’s need to know.`,
  remediaton: `To delete access keys

  1. Log in to your account using the root user credentials.

  2. Choose the account name near the top-right corner of the page and then choose **My Security Credentials**.

  3. In the pop-up warning, choose **Continue to Security Credentials**.

  4. Choose **Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)**.

  5. To permanently delete the key, choose **Delete** and then choose **Yes**. You cannot recover deleted keys.

  6. If there is more than one root user access key, then repeat steps 4 and 5 for each key.`,
